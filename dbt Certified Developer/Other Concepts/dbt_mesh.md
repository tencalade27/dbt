## What is dbt Mesh?
dbt Mesh is an architectural approach that enables multiple teams to collaborate on a single dbt project without creating bottlenecks. It allows different teams to own their own data models while still maintaining a unified analytics ecosystem.

+ Think of it as microservices for data teams.
+ Different teams can develop, test, and deploy models independently while ensuring consistency across the organization.

## Why Use dbt Mesh?
+ ✅ Scales dbt for large organizations with multiple teams.
+ ✅ Reduces bottlenecks—teams can work on their own dbt projects without stepping on each other’s toes.
+ ✅ Improves data ownership—each team is responsible for its own domain data models.
+ ✅ Encourages modular, reusable data models that different teams can leverage.
+ ✅ Enhances governance by enforcing common standards across teams.

## How dbt Mesh Works
+ 1️⃣ Multiple Teams, Multiple dbt Projects

Instead of one monolithic dbt project, each team has its own dbt repository (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Product).
Each team manages its own dbt models, tests, and transformations.
+ 2️⃣ Publishing and Sharing Models

Teams publish trusted, production-ready models into a shared warehouse.
Other teams consume these models as "external tables" instead of duplicating logic.
+ 3️⃣ Decoupled Development & Deployment

Each team deploys changes independently without affecting others.
Common governance and standards ensure consistency across teams.
