Challenge	                                      | Best Practice
------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
Siloed teams creating inconsistent models	      | Establish data governance with common modeling standards
Lack of visibility into other teams' models	    | Use dbt exposures and documentation to track dependencies
Difficulty coordinating breaking changes	      | Implement versioning and change management in dbt models
Managing data freshness	                        | Use dbt tests and alerts to ensure model accuracy
