## What Are Model Contracts in dbt?
Model contracts in dbt enforce schema and data type validations at the database level, ensuring that models always conform to expected structures.

With model contracts, you can:
✅ Prevent schema drift (unexpected column changes).
✅ Ensure downstream consumers always receive reliable data.
✅ Catch breaking changes before they impact production.
