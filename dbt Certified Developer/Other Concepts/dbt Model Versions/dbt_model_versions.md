## What Are dbt Model Versions?
Model versions in dbt allow you to manage schema changes over time without breaking downstream dependencies.

## With model versioning, you can:
+ ✅ Introduce changes incrementally without affecting consumers.
+ ✅ Maintain multiple versions of a model side by side.
+ ✅ Allow teams to migrate to new versions gradually.

Think of model versions like API versions—you can deprecate old versions while new versions are adopted.
