# Why is Cross-Project Orchestration Important?
+ ✅ Ensures models in one project are built before another project references them.
+ ✅ Helps teams modularize workflows while still collaborating on shared data.
+ ✅ Prevents stale or missing data issues due to out-of-sync project runs.
+ ✅ Supports dbt Mesh & Data Mesh architectures, where different teams own different datasets.
