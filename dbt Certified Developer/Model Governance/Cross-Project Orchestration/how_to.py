# How to Orchestrate Across dbt Projects?

# There are four main approaches to cross-project orchestration:

# 1️⃣ Use dbt Cloud's Job Dependencies (Easiest in dbt Cloud)
  # 🔹 Best for: Teams using dbt Cloud who want a no-code way to handle dependencies.

# How It Works:

# In dbt Cloud, you can set up job dependencies, ensuring that Project B runs only after Project A has finished.
# This prevents errors like referencing a model that hasn't been updated yet.

# Steps:

# In dbt Cloud, go to Deploy → Jobs.
# Create a job for Project A (e.g., dbt run for Finance models).
# Create a job for Project B, and under "Depends on", select Project A's job.
# ✅ Easy setup, no need for external orchestration tools.
# 🚫 Only works in dbt Cloud (not dbt Core).

# 2️⃣ Use an External Orchestration Tool (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, etc.)
  # 🔹 Best for: Teams using dbt Core or needing complex, cross-project workflows.

# How It Works:

# An external orchestrator (like Apache Airflow) manages dbt runs.
# Project A runs first, then Project B starts only if A completes successfully.
# This method scales well for complex workflows.

# Example with Apache Airflow (DAG) in Python:

from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.dbt.cloud.operators.dbt import DbtCloudRunJobOperator

with DAG("dbt_cross_project", schedule_interval="0 2 * * *") as dag:

    run_finance_project = DbtCloudRunJobOperator(
        task_id="run_finance_project",
        job_id=1234,  # Job ID from dbt Cloud
        wait_for_completion=True
    )

    run_marketing_project = DbtCloudRunJobOperator(
        task_id="run_marketing_project",
        job_id=5678,  # Job ID from dbt Cloud
        wait_for_completion=True
    )

    run_finance_project >> run_marketing_project  # Ensure Finance runs first

# ✅ Works with dbt Core & Cloud.
# ✅ Handles complex dependencies (e.g., retry logic, notifications).
# 🚫 Requires additional tools (Airflow, Dagster, etc.).

# 3️⃣ Use dbt Artifacts (run_results.json) for Dependency Tracking
  # 🔹 Best for: Teams using dbt Core who want a lightweight solution.

# How It Works:

# dbt generates a run_results.json file after each run.
# Another dbt project checks this file before running its own models.

# Example Approach:

# Project A Runs → Generates target/run_results.json.
# Project B Checks Project A’s Status → If successful, Project B runs.
# ✅ No external tools required (just some scripting).
# 🚫 Requires custom scripting to check dependencies.

# 4️⃣ Using dbt Cloud API for Triggering Runs
  # 🔹 Best for: Teams using dbt Cloud who need automated, API-based orchestration.

# How It Works:

# The dbt Cloud API triggers Project B's run once Project A completes successfully.

# Example API Call to Trigger a dbt Cloud Job in Bash:

curl --request POST \
  --url https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/accounts/{account_id}/jobs/{job_id}/run/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Token {dbt_cloud_api_token}'
# ✅ Flexible & automated.
# 🚫 Requires API setup & authentication.
