# What is Cross-Project Referencing in dbt?
Cross-project referencing allows you to use models from other dbt projects directly in your SQL queries. This is a powerful feature, especially in dbt Mesh architectures, where multiple teams maintain their own dbt projects.

## With Cross-Project ref, you can:
+ ✅ Leverage trusted data models from other teams or departments.
+ ✅ Avoid duplicating logic, ensuring a single source of truth.
+ ✅ Collaborate across projects while maintaining data governance.
