# Best for testing only a subset of records, such as recent data
# Example: validate that recent transactions have status = 'completed'
models:
  - name: transactions
    columns:
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['completed']
              where: "order_date >= current_date - interval '30' day"
# This only test the last 30 days of data, making checks faster and relevant
