# Use for when complex logic isn't covered by built-in tests
# Example: ensuring customer_lifetime_value is always positive

models:
  - name: customer_metrics
    columns:
      - name: customer_lifetime_value
        tests:
          - assert_positive
# fails if any negative values exist in the customer_lifetime_values column
