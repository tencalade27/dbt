# Best for checking foreign key integrity
# Example: ensuring all orders.customer_id exist in customers.customer_id
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('customers')
              field: customer_id
# This ensures referential integrity between tables
