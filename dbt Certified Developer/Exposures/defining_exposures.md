## What Are Exposures?
+ Exposures in dbt help document and track how your data models are used downstream—whether in dashboards, reports, or machine learning models.

Think of it like a bridge between your dbt project and your end users (analysts, business teams, ML engineers).
It helps you understand dependencies and track lineage from raw data → transformations → final reports.
