# dbt Grants – Managing Data Permissions in dbt
dbt grants is a feature that allows role-based access control (RBAC) at the model level within dbt. Instead of manually assigning permissions in the database, you can define who can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on your models directly in dbt_project.yml or your model .yml files.
