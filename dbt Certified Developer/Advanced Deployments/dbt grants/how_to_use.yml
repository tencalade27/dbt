# 1) defining grants
# you can set default permissions for models:
models:
  my_project:
    staging:
      +grants:
        select: ["analyst", "data_engineer"]
# use case: grants SELECT access to analyst and data_engineer for all staging models

# 2) assigning grants in a model's YAML file
models:
  - name: sales_report
    description: "Aggregated sales data"
    grants:
      select: ["sales_analyst"]
      insert: ["etl_user"]
      update: ["etl_user"]
# use case:
  # sales_analyst can only query the data
  # etl_user can modify the data

# 3) running dbt run with grants applied
# when executing models, dbt applies the defined permissions aytomatically
dbt run --select sales_report
